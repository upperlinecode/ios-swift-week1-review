##Warming Up for Week Two
Use anything from last week that you might need to solve the following challenges. Do your work in an Xcode playground.

1) Write a program that will draw the a staircase of height *n*.
 
Example Output:

```Swift
staircase(0)

//prints:
//No steps here!


staircase(3)

//prints:
//  #
// ##
//###


staircase(6)

//prints:
//     #
//    ##
//   ###
//  ####
// #####
//######
```

2) Given an array of integers, calculate the fraction of elements that are positive.


Example Output:

```Swift
fractionPositive([1, -6, 8, 3])

//prints:
//0.75 of these integers are positive


fractionPositive([-5, -9, -100, 0, -3])

//prints:
//0.2 of these integers are positive



fractionPositive([])

//prints:
//That array is empty!
```

3) Given a time in AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.


Example Output:

```Swift
amPmToMilitary("03:15:20PM")

//prints:
//Military time: 15:15:20


amPmToMilitary("12:00:00AM")

//prints:
//Military time: 00:00:00



amPmToMilitary("12:30:00PM")

//prints:
//Military time: 12:30:00
```
